CNN-Based Underpass Flood Detection
Objective
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect flood levels in underpasses using image processing techniques. By leveraging deep learning, the system can provide real-time flood detection, helping to enhance urban safety and prevent accidents.

Methodology
Data Collection: Collected images of underpasses in different flood conditions.
Data Preprocessing: Applied image augmentation, normalization, and resizing to ensure consistency.
Model Development: Used a CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
Training & Evaluation: Trained the model on labeled datasets and evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: The trained model can be integrated into real-world applications for flood detection.
Results
Achieved high accuracy in classifying flood severity levels.
Demonstrated robust performance in varying lighting and weather conditions.
Can be further improved with additional real-world data and fine-tuning.
Future Scope
Integration with IoT-based monitoring systems.
Enhancement using transfer learning with pre-trained models.
Deployment as a mobile or web-based application for real-time monitoring.
